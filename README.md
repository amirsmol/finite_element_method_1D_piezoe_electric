finite_element_method_1D_piezoe_electric
========================================

This is a 1D finite element model for 1D analysis.
The code used multiple subrouines including lapack.
It was based on the book 


@book{reddy2004introduction,
  title={An Introduction to Nonlinear Finite Element Analysis},
  author={Reddy, J.N.},
  isbn={9780198525295},
  lccn={2004401814},
  url={http://books.google.com/books?id=gV2EN71IjwgC},
  year={2004},
  publisher={OUP Oxford}
}

and also the course that I have taken in Texas A&M unviersity.
It uses other subroutines from web that have been written by others I included their licence.
